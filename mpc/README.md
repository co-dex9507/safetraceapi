## Shamir Secret Sharing 

The `Shamir` class is a set of methods for a secure (t, n) secret sharing scheme where any t+1 out of n total shares are needed to reconstruct a secret value. The scheme works over the field GF(2^8) for it's applicability to muilti party computtaion with boolean circuits.

```
>>> from shamir import Shamir
>>> shamir = Shamir(2,5)
>>> shares = shamir.share_secret(15)
>>> shares
[(1, 168), (2, 169), (3, 14), (4, 185), (5, 30)]
>>> int(shamir.recontsruct_secret(shares[:3]))
15
>>> shares = shamir.share_bitstring_secret('10010101010010')
>>> shamir.reconstruct_bitstring_secret(shares[2:])
'10010101010010'
```

### SSS Linear Homomorphism (for free!)

Shamir Secret Sharing as *linearly* homomorphic out of the box. If each player in the MPC protocol takes an index [1,..,n] and gets their share [x] of secret value x and [y] of secret value y, they can locally combine their shares to get a share [x+y]. Here's proof below:

```
>>> from gf256 import GF256
>>> from shamir import Shamir
>>> x = GF256(1)
>>> y = GF256(2)
>>> shamir = Shamir(2,5)
>>> x_shares = shamir.share_secret(x)
>>> y_shares = shamir.share_secret(y)
>>> result_shares = [x_shares[i]+y_shares[i] for i in range(len(x_shares))]
>>> shamir.reconstruct_secret(result_shares[:3]) == x+y
True
```

Similarly a secret shared value x can be multiplied by a public value c with simple local computations by all parties. Each player with share [x] can do c\*[x] to obtain a share [c\*x].

```
>>> from gf256 import GF256
>>> from shamir import Shamir
>>> x = GF256(25)
>>> c = GF256(3)
>>> shamir = Shamir(2,5)
>>> x_shares = shamir.share_secret(x)
>>> result_shares = [share.scalar_mul(c) for share in x_shares]
>>> shamir.reconstruct_secret(result_shares[:3]) == c*x
True
```

### SSS Multiplicative Homomorphism (with triples trick)

Shamir Secret Sharing is multiplicatively homomorphic except that the threshold number of shares needed for reconstruction doubles after every multiplication. To mitigate this problem there is a preprocessing phase to create a "TripleShare" three values [a],[b],[c] where secret values a,b,c have relationship a\*b=c.

Players first compute:
```
[epsilon] = [x-a]
[rho] = [y-b]
```

Then they broadcast shares [epsilon] and [rho] to all other parties. Players then compute result share [r]:

```
epsilon = reconstruct([epsilon]_1, [epsilon_2]...)
rho = reconstruct([rho]_1, [rho]_2...)
[r] = rho*[x] + epsilon*[y] - epsilon\*rho
[r] = [(y-b)*x] + [(x-a)*y] - (x-a)*(y-b) + c
[r] = [(xy-xb) + (xy-ya) - (xy-ya-xb+ab) + ab]
[r] = [xy]
```

With this protocol (involving one round of communication and pre-created TripleShares) we can compute multiplications homomorphically in the secret shared space. Proof of this can be seen in test_secure_multiplication in the test file shamir_test.py

## Circuits

We'll need to generate and evaluate boolean circuits for desired computations. We've started with a very basic machine code format. This will probably be updated/adapted but we have to start somewhere:

```
1. The first two positions on the tape are reserved for constants 0 and 1 (in positions 0 and 1 respectively)

2. The first line of machine code has one integer K specifying the number of input bits. These inputs take tape positions 2, 3, ..., K+2.

3. Each subsequent line of machine code takes two bits on two tape positions applies the given operation (AND / XOR). The result bit is put in the next tape position ()

4. Last lines of machine code list the output bits (labeled OUT)
```

If we can compile circuits in this format then we can evaluate them in clear text to verify the circuit works as desired. Then we can "run" the same circuit but with MPC protocols and shares for input rather than plaintext bits.
